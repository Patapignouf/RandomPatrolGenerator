	 *
	 * Function to handle a civilian unit equipped with a mine that can be defused or explode based on certain conditions.
	 *
	 * This function initializes a civilian unit by assigning it a vest, changing its side, and equipping it with a mine.
	 * The mine is attached to the civilian and hidden. The function sets up event handlers for when the civilian is killed, 
	 * which includes handling the mine's explosion or defuse actions, and creating a holder object for the mine with a defuse action.
	 * 
	 * The function also includes logic for updating the mine's behavior based on the distance from players, 
	 * and determines whether the mine should explode based on player proximity.
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 * - _civilian: (OBJECT) The civilian unit to be processed. It must be of type "Man" and belong to the specified side.
	 *
	 * Returns:
	 * - None
	 *
	 * Example Usage:
 * // Initialize a civilian unit with the mine setup and handling
	 * [myCivilian] spawn civils_fnc_suicidebomber;
	 * 
	 * @param OBJECT _civilian - The civilian unit to be processed.
