# RandomPatrolGenerator

This is a little project  to make a new experience for ArmA 3 players.
Between DynamicReconOps, TRGM2 and DirectAction, RandomPatrolGenerator is a little missionGenerator, optimize to allow players to keep 60 FPS on modern configuration.
It can be played RP or Arcade style with one or two factions doing the same mission on different way.

There are some features like :
- Various objectives (VIP, Ammo cache, Defense, Take & Hold etc.),
- Civilian conversation system,
- Class restricted arsenal,
- Custom respawn system,
- Custom XP system (cosmetic rank implemented),
- Opfor reinforcement from ground and air,
- Opfor FOB (challenging tasks),
- Intel management,
- Support and vehicle shops for blufor,
- Civilian recruits for independent,
- Hostile civilians,
- Blufor aircraft carrier,
- Custom mission setup,
- Custom scoreboard on mission's end,
- Ironman mod (stuff loose on death).

Support for factions from :
- Vanilla game,
- CUP,
- UNSUNG,
- IFA3,
- RHS,
- KORSAC,
- AMF.

Highly recommand to play with LAMBS_Danger, VCOM and ACE3 for the best experience.

Factions are manually implemented with a factionTemplate and every missions are different.

Initially made for hardcore player, there is settings to allow player respawn on objective completion or time.

Just start a game and enjoy :)
